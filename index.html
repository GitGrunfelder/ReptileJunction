				<h2>Welcome to Reptile Junction</h2>

				<div class="flex">
				<p>We are Reptile Junction, serving the Upstate with all the scaly (or not so scaly) critters you have ever wanted. Though we are based in the Carolinas, you can find us traveling to repticons and other conventions all over the east coast.</p>
				<p>You can follow us on social media to see what adventures we have ahead and to keep up with the current critters! We also provide care sheets, tips, and recommendations for the animals we sell here.</p>

				<p>We breed and sell only crested geckos and panther chameleons at the moment, with plans to expand our offerings in the near future. We also offer any supplies a reptile owner may need, ranging from heat lamps and enclosures to crickets and mealworms. We hope to fulfill any of your reptile needs!</p>
