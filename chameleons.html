				He is a northeastern coast panther chameleon, part of the furcifer pardalis chameleon species.
				</p>

				<h3>Facts</h3>
				<p>
				The panther chameleon is a species of chameleon found in the eastern and northern parts of Madagascar in a tropical forest biome.
				Since panther chameleons are native to the northern and coastal areas of Madagascar, they live in trees and bushes, mostly in the coastal lowlands where it is warm and humid.
				Wild panthers in their natural habitat may live only one or two years due to the perils of predators, parasites and disease.
				Females that are well cared for and breed in captivity (which often decreases their lifespan), may average 2 to 3 years of age.
				Virgin females, on the other hand, have been documented to live up to eight years when freed from the toll reproduction places on their lives.
				Males in captivity can average 3 to 5 years of age, with extreme exceptions of 8 and 9.
				The panther chameleon does not change color to instantly match any background it is placed against. Panthers do exhibit color change, though, for a variety of reasons, including a method of communication, to better absorb or reflect radiant heat, and to blend in with natural habitat.
				Panther chameleon color can help determine where in Madagascar a chameleon may have originated. </p>
				<h3>Care</h3>
				<p>
				Ideal humidity for panther chameleons is 75-90% which can be measured with a hygrometer. Live plants can assist with keeping the humidity up between mistings.
				Panther chameleons are extremely sensitive to high quality UVB lighting, which is essential for their proper bone development and growth.
				Feed chameleons daily. The amount depends upon their size, but feed as many insects as they can consume in one sitting. Although the lizards appreciate variety, crickets will likely be the staple diet.
				Gut load all insects first with a high-calcium food, such as store-bought greens or a commercial gut load. After gut loading, dust each insect with a vitamin supplement.</p>
				<h3>Breeding</h3>
				<p>When breeding panther chameleons, the eggs should be spaced out within the moist vermiculite. The duration of incubation ranges from 6 months to 12 months depending on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Once laid, panther chameleon eggs remain in diapause for between 3 to 6 months before developing further.
				Male panther chameleons are able to mate at around 8 months old when they measure 10 to 12 inches long.
				Females may also mate at this age, but waiting until they are at least a year old, when they measure between 14 and 18 inches long, is best for their reproductive health.
				Males are generally ready to breed immediately. Females, however, must be ready before they accept advances. Unreceptive females turn black, hiss, gape and attempt to bite advancing males. Receptive females change from their normal brown, white and khaki colors to a beautiful salmon pink.
				Breeding can take several hours. You may keep them together for multiple mating sessions until the female rejects the male, which can take a day or two. You donâ€™t have to watch them the entire time, but check on them often to make sure everything is OK. The male may get too aggressive, and the female must be removed if that happens.
				Gestation is 20 to 30 days. Roughly 10 to 15 days after mating, the female stops eating until she lays eggs.
