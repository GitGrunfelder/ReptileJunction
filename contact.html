				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<div class="flex">
				<p><strong>Is my gecko eating?</strong></p>
				<p>It most likely is eating. You may be overfeeding. Cut back on serving sizes. Search for droppings!</p>
				<p><strong>My gecko hasn't grown much, what gives?</strong></p>
				<p>You may need to incorporate a variety of foods such as gut-loaded insects (think crickets) in order to speed up weight-gain. Feeding just pangea likely isn't enough. Try a diverse range of fruits as well.</p>
				<p><strong>Do crested geckos make good first reptiles?</strong></p>
				<p>Yes, crested geckos are very easy to care for. They are very tame, require no special gadgetry or temperatures, and will thrive in most conditions. See the <a href="geckos.html">gecko</a> page for tips on care.</p>
				<p><strong>Do geckos bite?</strong></p>
				<p>They may bite if overly stressed in order to escape, but it does not hurt and they don't have sharp teeth. You may want to give your gecko some space if this occurs and try handling at a later time. It may take time to develop a bond with your pet.</p>
				<p><strong>Why do the geckos' prices vary?</strong></p>
				<p>Crested geckos come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and some of these are harder to breed for. An especially aesthetically pleasing lizard is in high demand, and genetics are the key to producing these rare reptiles. It costs more to purchase breeders with these desired traits.</p>
				<p><strong>Do chameleons need companions?</strong></p>
				<p>No, chameleons are generally solitary reptiles.</p>
				<p><strong>What size enclosures do these reptiles require?</strong></p>
				<p>An adult male panther chameleon requires at least a 24x24x48 in. enclosure, preferably a screen cage due to ventilation. A female panther chameleon only requires a 18x18x36 in. enclosure. Crested geckos can live in a 18x18x24 in. glass enclosure. It is generally safe to stick to the rule of thumb that larger is better in terms of space.</p>
