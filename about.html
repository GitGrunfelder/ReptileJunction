				<h3>Catherine</h3>
				<p>Catherine Evans was born right here in South Carolina. After moving to Florida for a short while, she became very interested in the wildlife around there, especially of the reptilian kind. After moving back to South Carolina, she met Autumn and they eventually became close friends. After Autumn got her first reptile, Catherine fell in love and got convinced by Autumn to get a crested gecko. That was the beginning for Catherine.</p>

				<p>Catherine has two dogs named Zena and Brandy, a cat named Kalista, and two crested geckos. Catherine purchased the male crested gecko Bones from Repticon. He is 2 years old. He is a bicolor dalmation. Catherine rescued the geckos Chekhov and Spock earlier this year, 2020. We do not know how old they are. Chekhov has some splatter spots on him. He is a tricolor harlequin. He has partial pinstripes.
				</p>

				<p>Autumn and Catherine travel to numerous reptile events throughout the year and have a passion for all things reptile. Both are driven to meet the needs of customers while ensuring the safety and quality of their reptiles.</p>

				<h3>Autumn</h3>
				<p> 
				Autumn Smith was born in Florida but grew up in the Carolinas. She has always loved animals of all kinds. She got her first reptile when she was 15, a veiled chameleon named Rango and just fell in love with reptiles. After Autumn and Catherine became friends, Autumn got a crested gecko named Sprocket, who is actually the gecko in our logo! Sprocket isn’t big enough to breed even though she is of “mature” age, so she is our mascot.
				</p>

				<p>Autumn has multiple reptiles and pets. Uhura is our first female breeder crested gecko; she is 38 grams and 2 years old. She is a partial pinstripe flame. 
				Uhura recently laid her first egg with Chekhov!
