				<h3>Facts</h3>
				<p>Crested geckos are native to Southern New Caledonia and were thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 because of a tropical storm that tossed one at a ranger station. 
				Crested geckos will drop their tails when they are too scared or stressed as a defense. They are one of the few geckos that don't grow their tails back but don't worry if this happens to your gecko just make sure you keep the wound clean for a couple days while it heals.</p>
				
				<h3>Care</h3>
				<p>Crested geckos love to climb so when you get one make sure you get them a tall tank not a wide one and fill it with lots of vines and plants for them to climb on they will love you for it. 
				Cresties like their enclosure to be between 68° and 78°F. 
				They are also nocturnal which means they sleep all day and are up all night so you don't need any special lighting for them. We also recommend that if you are a light sleeper you probably shouldn't keep them where you sleep. They tend to make a lot of noise jumping around their cage. 
				Crested geckos like to drink water off the walls and leaves so make sure you mist their cages daily. You can do this with a spray bottle or you can get an automatic sprayer.
				 
				Crested geckos love fruit and sometimes insects. You can buy fruit and puree them or you can buy fruit paste that you can find at most local pet stores or online. 	
				We like to use pangea.  

				Please do not house multiple males together they are very territorial and will end up hurting each other. 
				You can put multiple females together just make sure they are around the same size and that you have plenty of space for them to get away from each other. 
				We do recommend that the best thing for your geckos is to house all of them separately; they are just happier alone.
				</p>

				<h3>Breeding</h3>
				<p>Simply putting an adult male and female together in the same enclosure will result in copulation within days, if not hours. 
				Both male and female must be sexually mature before you introduce the male into the female's enclosure. Female crested geckos need to weigh a minimum of 38 to 40 grams and be 11/2 years old to start breeding. Males can weigh slightly less, though they may not exhibit any interest in copulating until they're about 2 years old.  
				Depending on the male, courting may be gentle and consist of a series of chirps and head bobbing prior to copulation, or it may appear violent and aggressive. It is normal for the male to bite the female by the head crests and mount her during the mating process.
				During a breeding season, female crested geckos will lay a clutch of two eggs every 30 to 45 days. When a gravid female is ready to deposit eggs, she will seek out a moist place in which to do so.
